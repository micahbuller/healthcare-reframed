date: "2020-01-01"
description: "In this episode, we are talking with Somava Saha. She is a primary care physician who began her medical career in rural Guyana where she learned how radical change can be accomplished even with very limited resources. She went on to leadership roles at Cambridge Health Alliance in Boston, at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and at her own non-profit organization, WE (Wellness and Equity) in the World.  She is a passionate and tireless advocate for a better world, and she believes that as healthcare leaders it is our responsibility to “get it together and make things better” for our patients and our communities."

We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.
 
You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:
 
- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation
 
You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.
 
On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.
 
In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
