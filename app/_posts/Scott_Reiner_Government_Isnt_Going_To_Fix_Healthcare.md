title: "Scott Reiner: Trading the C-suite for community impact"
date: "2020-01-02"
description: "I worked for a number of years as a senior hospital executive for Adventist Health, a $5 billion system in the western US.  Our guest in this episode, Scott Reiner, was the CEO of that system until, at the peak of his career, he walked away to launch a pair of social ventures working to reframe the approach to healthcare in rural southern Africa. In his time at Adventist Health, Scott completely changed the way that I think about healthcare, and I had always wanted to have a chance to sit down with him and hear his take on his journey and on healthcare in general. I hope that you find our conversation as interesting and inspiring as I did."

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.
 
- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.
 
Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
