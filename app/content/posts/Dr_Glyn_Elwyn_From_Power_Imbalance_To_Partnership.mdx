title: "From Power Imbalance to Partnership — Dartmouth’s Dr. Glyn Elwyn: Meaning & Purpose in the Exam Room"
date: "20205-09-12"
description: "World leader in shared decision‑making Dr. Glyn Elwyn (Dartmouth) joins Judson to unpack co‑production in healthcare: what it looks like in real visits, why simple tools like Option Grid change choices, and how SDM can protect clinicians from burnout and moral injury while improving outcomes and patient trust. Glyn traces his path from rural Wales—through a lab explosion, an arts degree, and a “back‑door” into medicine—to building the field’s most used measures (Observer OPTION‑5, CollaboRATE) and pushing health systems to become true learning health systems. We also explore ambient listening, elective surgery utilization, primary‑care access, and what leaders (and payers) can do tomorrow."

**Judson:** There's a moment it seems that when every world changer decides that something is important, there seems to be a gut punch moment for them. When they decide that the field or the passion they're gonna go into is, is worth their effort and time for co-production, shared decision making. Do you have that gut punch moment?

**Glyn:** Really tough question actually. Um, I, you know, I mean, I guess you need to think about what led to this interest. Um, probably one of the most salient things to say is that I lost my father.

Yeah, probably one of the most salient things to say is that I, I lost my father

when I was seven, so he died suddenly one night of a massive heart attack. So I think that changed my life a lot. So then I grew up, you know, with, um, a very young mother. Um, she was, um, 26, I think at the time when she was widowed. And, and so, you know, it wasn't, um, a tough, uh, childhood, but it was different, right.

Um, I had to kind of find my own way a little bit. Had to become a bit autonomous.

**Judson:** Where did you find, uh, mentorship in an environment like that?

**Glyn:** I'm not sure. I did actually. Um, some of the school teachers were pretty good later on, but I think at first I, I struggled to find my way, um, in that environment.

Um, I also realized I think that nobody else is gonna make things happen, right? It was, it was on me. And so, yeah, at first I wasn't that good at school and I, I kind of realized at the age of about 12 or 13 that if I was gonna make anything happen, it was, it was gonna be me. So. I guess I started to work a bit harder and you know, at the time as well, actually, I made the decision, and this may sound strange to you, but my education up until that time had been in English and there was a new development in Wales at a time where you could choose to educate yourself in the medium of Welsh.

My, my, my mother tongue. Um, I learned English when I was nine because the television arrived actually. And my father at the time, um, before he died, brought the first television into the community because he was capable enough to set up a generator to run the electricity, to run the television. So all the neighbors came around to watch the television in our house.

And after that, a few years later, English came because of the cartoons came and so on. Cartoons from America. Anyway, I digress, but that's important I think because. Changing into the medium of Welsh gave me a much smaller classroom and some very motivated teachers who said, huh, you seem to be doing okay.

And after that I decided, huh, I'm pretty good at the sciences. You know, physics, biology, chemistry. But I was also a bit stupid, honestly, because I, I had a home laboratory and I had bottles of ether on the shelf in the laboratory at home, and one of these Ether bottles blew up one day and I was caught in a fire and had to go to a hospital for a few months.

So that was a rude awakening to say, don't mess with Ether bottles. Um, and so at that time, also lack of mentorship. You know, I decided, ah, I can't, I've lost a year of school. I can't possibly go into medicine anymore, which is what, what I was aiming for. So I decided to go do an arts degree. So I did Welsh and theater in a, in a university in North Wales called Bangor University.

So I enjoyed that tremendously, and I learned an enormous amount about theater. You know, the, the Absurdist Theater in France and Brecht in Germany, and so many things. Um, and I, I probably. Decided, you know, I'm not sure if I want to be a teacher. 'cause that was the route really I was heading for, right?

Mm-hmm. So I decided to talk to my professor at the time he was called Bed Louis Jones, and say, Hey, would you write me a letter to try and get, if I can try to get to medical school? And he did. And the caveat was I had to get a high enough, a good enough degree to get entry into medical school. So that's how things started.

**Judson:** Paint the picture for me. You're, you're applying for medical school. How challenging was it in that time in, in Wales to get into medical school?

**Glyn:** Well, I'd done a first degree, right? So I was a bit older because in, in, in the uk you go to medical school at 1819. So most of my people when I went to medical school were three years younger than me.

They were 18, 19. By this point I was 21, 22 because I'd done an arts degree. Yeah. So I was unusual at medical school. I don't think it was that difficult, but I was very fortunate because I'm not sure I would've got the grades in biology, physics, and chemistry. I had a Welsh degree, right? Mm-hmm. And so there was a route, what I call the backdoor into medicine, which called the first MB, which is you study in university in Cardiff at the time.

Um, and, uh, for one year in order to qualify you to get into medical school. And that, that first year was great. I studied botany of all things and then I got through the back door into medical school. So that was a kind of a lucky stroke for me.

**Judson:** You said your first degree was in arts? Yeah. How has that shaped your practice of medicine?

**Glyn:** Oh, big time. Big time. Because I learned a lot about, you know, what's driving human behavior, um, how people interact and communicate with each other. I put on a lot of plays and directed plays and I was, I was quite an, quite the actor for a while.

**Judson:** Has that shaped in any way, the way that you engage with patients?

Yeah. Gimme an example.

**Glyn:** Well, I, you know, um, theater is all about communicating and conveying emotions and, um, having impact on an audience. And I, and I think when you are communicating in healthcare on an interpersonal level, it's all about those listening and, and being curious. Um. And, and being aware of the person in front of you so that you are communicating deeply with them.

So that's probably been quite a big influence in terms of my choice of area to focus.

**Judson:** Was your mother supportive of you making that transition to medical school? Well,

**Glyn:** all these decisions about my education changing to do my education in Welsh and going to university were my decisions. She, she, yeah. She wasn't part of that decision making.

**Judson:** Why is that?

**Glyn:** Not her world grew up in a very different time. Um, you know, hadn't been to university, hadn't been to college, she was not familiar with that world.

**Judson:** So even the act of you going to college was, um, outside of the precedent set by your immediate, um, role models.

**Glyn:** I don't, I don't know any of my, in my community that did that route.

**Judson:** And yet you've become this world changer and you wake up every day thinking about ways to advance the things that you're passionate about.

**Glyn:** Well, I've certainly worked at it. I'm not sure I would wake up every day thinking about it, but I've tried to push this area forward if I, you know, that's my, that's been my goal.

**Judson:** Walk us through the Welsh experience about how you enter the practice environment.

**Glyn:** Um, so here I am in medical school, um, a very strange environment for, you know, um, a boy who grew up on a farm in North Wales, right. Um, uh, meeting people who'd got mothers and fathers and generations who'd been to university before.

So it was new, um, and. I had a role model in my own community, uh, who actually, the doctor who came to visit my father her night, he died. Who, who was a family doctor, a general practitioner, as we call them, in the uk. And he was a big role model for me. You know, he was esteemed in his local community. He knew everybody.

Um, and that at the time was a very important role model for me in terms of maybe I could be somebody like that, who, who's was, was really important in the community. And, um, paint

**Judson:** adds value. Paint the picture for me. So we're in Sia, it's a mountainous region, I, I believe. Mm-hmm. You mentioned you were on a farm.

Why, why would your father have died of a heart attack in that setting as opposed to receive interventional cardiology care in that environment?

**Glyn:** Um, well, he was a big smoker. I think he had around 40 unfiltered cigarettes a day. 'cause that's what people did in the, you know, at that time, um, he had a massive heart attack.

I don't think his diet was very good, you know. Um, but he, the main issue was smoking. Um, there was no telephone in the house. You call the doctor. He came two or three hours later, um, in the middle of the night. Interventional cardiology. Nobody knew what that was. He died in his bed.

**Judson:** Hmm. So this GP comes, general practitioner comes several hours later.

Mm-hmm. Did you know this gp, was it, was this your GP as a family?

**Glyn:** Yeah, Dr. Davis. Yeah.

**Judson:** Did he.

**Glyn:** He was on call every night of the week, every night of the year. 365 days a year. Absolutely.

**Judson:** Did he have lived experiences as well? Was he in that community as well? Sure. Living a similar life.

**Glyn:** Everybody knew him.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. He lived all his life there. Yeah. Yeah. He grew up there.

**Judson:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he had gone off

**Glyn:** to college somewhere and gone back here.

**Judson:** Yes. And largely that's what you did as well then?

**Glyn:** Well, no, I mean, I went to Cardiff, which is five hours away from where I lived, and then I, I went into, actually, I went to Africa and then got back to Cardiff, and that's a longer story.

But, um, I eventually settled in general practice in Cardiff, in Wales. How long did you practice in general practice? It's probably about a decade. And then I, I became interested in medical education. I did a master's in medical education, and that sparked my interest in. Doing a bit more actually around writing.

And I decided to do a PhD and a doctorate, and I went to the Netherlands to do that. Um, I was, uh, I'd been in Wales in terms all the time in my education apart from being a year in Africa, as I mentioned, and I wanted to see how other people did things. So that was a very important move for me, actually, the PhD in the, in the Netherlands.

**Judson:** What did you study your PhD in?

**Glyn:** Shared decision making.

**Judson:** Really? Yeah. The PhD is in shared decision making.

**Glyn:** Yeah. I developed an instrument to measure whether or not clinicians are doing it or not. At the time it was 12 items where. We videotape, um, just what we're doing now or audiotape a doctor and a patient doing their work.

Um, and we assess to what degree they are giving them treatment choices, whether or not they're explaining the choices, whether or not they're listening to what the patient think about those choices, whether they try and match then the choice to what the patients thinks is important. Mm-hmm. So that's the core of shared decision making and we've, this measure has been used many, many times now by many people over the world to, to assess whether or not clinicians are doing that process.

**Judson:** What led you to develop that process?

**Glyn:** There was a guy from Dartmouth here called Al Mulley. Um, he was actually, well actually he was at Harvard at the time, but he came to Wales to give a lecture. And he talked about these tools called decision tools, decision aids. And I went to listen to him and I, I'd never heard about this, a funny idea that came from Boston about involving patients in decisions.

So I read into that, got more interested, and that's why I said, well, but we don't know whether or not clinicians are doing this. So that sparked my interest. And after a couple of years of reading more about it, I said, may, maybe we can develop a measure here. And actually, I was interested in having a, a PhD, a doctorate, as well as a, a medical degree.

So that's how that happened.

**Judson:** Take me to the first time that you tried to apply decision aids in a patient experience in your practice.

**Glyn:** Well, we started off with very, very simple tools. There was a colleague of mine, um, in Cardiff called Adrian Edwards and myself, and we said, let's give people some bar charts, some colored charts of how often something happens, how often a benefit happens if we give somebody a treatment, how often the harm happens, or side effects, and we'll give them these charts on pieces of paper and we'll try and help the clinicians give these pieces of paper to them and explain that there are more than one option possible.

So that's where we started. We got some funding for that. Actually we were both early researchers at the time. So that's the first example. And of course, this measure called Observer Option 12. At the time, it's now five items, observer, option five, we, we began to use that to see whether the clinicians were changing their behavior or not.

So that was the first example.

**Judson:** How was that received when you first rolled that out?

**Glyn:** You know, there was a bit of an interest. Um, we got enough doctors to try them. How'd you do that? Uh, we had a trial. We got a funding from, um, you know, the government to do a trial. Um, and we got enough clinicians, primary care doctors, actually general practitioners interested to try these tools out.

But of course, it was a study and once the study was over, that was it, you know, there was, there was more, no more interest.

**Judson:** What was the result of the study?

**Glyn:** Oh, we showed that by using these tools, the involvement levels between the clinicians and the patients went up.

**Judson:** When you say involvement, like what's the problem that we're trying to solve with involvement?

**Glyn:** Well, traditionally in medicine, clinicians will say, here's the diagnosis and here's what we're gonna do here. Here's here's the treatment. But increasingly, um, in medicine, there's more than one possible treatment. And this was now, you know, in the nineties, well, late nineties, early two thousands, by this time it's even more true to say that there are many treatment options that you need to, in my view, put in front of the patient to say, what's gonna fit your life and your preferences.

So that's at the core of shared decision making, is to say, I'm curious enough about you to see what's gonna suit you. At the time, this was a very new idea. You know, the, the measure I developed in the Netherlands, um, nobody had done anything before like this. And so our trial was the first trial of a decision aid in Britain, essentially.

**Judson:** This is novel to the practice of medicine where you were at.

**Glyn:** Yeah.

**Judson:** Why was this not just innate to the practice of medicine in your community at that time?

**Glyn:** Well, it was not innate to the practice of medicine anywhere apart from these, uh, people in Boston, um, Al Molly, Mike Barry, Jack Winberg in Dartmouth, and so on, beginning to talk about this idea of sharing decisions with patients.

So this was a focus. And then there was another focus in Ottawa, um, uh, Annette O'Connor and her group there. But this was very new. Um, there was a very famous paper from Canada called, it Takes Two to Tango by Kathy Charles, a sociologist from McMaster, who kind of brought this idea, at least to academic medicine.

And from then other people began to say, Hmm, that's an interesting idea, but it's, it's never gonna happen. It's too idealistic. This is not how medicine is practiced.

**Judson:** I want to just for me to understand better, so what I'm hearing, the root issue is you have a highly trained professional speaking to a patient that is assumed to be less educated in that topic, which is likely factually true.

**Glyn:** Yeah.

**Judson:** And that's leading to some sort of a power dynamic mm-hmm. Between the two. Mm-hmm.

**Glyn:** Yeah. Power asymmetry. Power asymmetry. Mm-hmm. And, and I think that the role of a clinician is to level the playing field so that people understand what they're getting into and that they make choices, which is aligned with what they feel is best for them.

You can't do that without informing them. If I say, would you like this or this fruit? Or this fruit, I'm gonna have to explain to you, or at least give you a taste of each, right? To say, which one is your preference? So the idea of shared decision making is to give you enough information that you've got enough, enough data to make a choice that you feel is aligned with your interests.

**Judson:** Is interest the word or values?

**Glyn:** Values maybe. Values are difficult things, right? Um, because, uh. They're a bit abstract values. Um, what I'm gonna say to you is that this side effect happens in this percentage of people. This benefit happens in this percentage of people. On the average, there's more, Ben, there's more benefits than harms, but some people value some benefits more than others.

So, which it is for you. And, and, and I think a lot of doctors feel that this is too cumbersome, too much work, too complicated it to put in front of patients. My argument would be, and an argument a lot of my colleagues buy now, is to say, this is a much more equitable way to practice medicine.

**Judson:** I've heard people say that humans broadly or generally do not understand risk.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm.

**Judson:** Well,

**Glyn:** mm-hmm.

**Judson:** So wouldn't that conflict with your ability to help them, the patient, make an equitable decision or a, an interest aligned decision?

**Glyn:** It's true that numeracy is difficult to gauge, right? In terms of imagining future risk is difficult, um, 5%, 10%, 15%, but you can help people understand what a possible future looks like, that most people end up with this kind of outcome, a small percentage have this kind of outcome.

How much do you want to be in the camp with these kind of outcomes versus these kind of outcomes? And is there anything about what I've described to you so far worrying you or looks attractive to you?

**Judson:** Are you normally talking to the patient or more of a. Family member or child or spouse?

**Glyn:** Well, ideally patient and their relatives.

And, and, and, and typically what happens when you share a decision this kind of way with a patient is that they say, whoa, hang on a moment. I didn't realize that I had to be involved. I had to take responsibility. I wanna talk to my relative. So the, one of the challenges of this approach is that this slows things down because people want time to think, they want time to discuss with their family members.

And medicine's not built like that. It's built for speed and efficiency and, and seeing a lot of people quickly,

**Judson:** does it really slow down or is that just a narrative that people, um, are, are, is that a fear that practitioners have? Have you measured that?

**Glyn:** You know, they say it does slow it down a bit, but not by much.

But what I would probably argue is that it makes it, for most decisions are not urgent. Not that urgent. You may need more than one visit and one conversation, which for a major decision, I think is completely appropriate, especially if you're having a, taking a medicine for the rest of your life or for many years, or thinking about a procedure that's going to have some effect on your, on your life.

So I think it's fair enough to deliberate carefully about that decision. So it does slow it down a little bit in my view. And it requires an investment of time for both the patient, which is unusual for them and the doctor, which is also unusual for them

**Judson:** in a clinical environment where shared decision making is happening well versus a clinical environment where it's not happening at all, what's, what's the effect on utilization downstream from that visit?

**Glyn:** Right. So this is a complicated question. Um. There's a emerging evidence base that if you do this well, people adhere to their chosen medication or treatment in a much better way. And, and it's kind of logical, right? If I've involved you in this decision and you've understood what's involved in making that decision or carrying on with this medicine, you are likely much more adherent to that because you've bought into it.

If you've invested in it yourself. Uh, we know that when people with asthma, for example, learn about the brown inhaler and the brew inhaler and which one to use first, they understand how to self-manage. And so they've invested their ability to titrate sometimes the medication to their needs, but also how to manage their asthma or long-term condition.

So in those situations. Shared decision making makes a lot of sense and leads to better outcomes. There's also evidence to say that when you explain to people, do I need a new hip on a new knee? And they understand how there's a lot of work getting back to my normal function after a new knee, maybe months of physiotherapy before I can, you know, work again or, uh, ski or play tennis or whatever, they say, well, maybe I'll wait.

Um, I'm not quite ready for that yet. So people make conservative decisions when they know what's involved. They, they act in their best interests.

**Judson:** You're saying statistically they're more conservative? Yes. And potentially you're saying that that is also in their best interest? Yes. So is

**Glyn:** well, well, well, the patient has decided that that's in their best, that's in their best interest.

Yes.

**Judson:** Yeah. Take us back to the storyline then. So chronologically, you're. You, you've, you, you're experiment. You've, you've got this research grant to experiment with the early phases of, um, these decision aid tools. Where does this go?

**Glyn:** I do more of that kind of research, um, after my PhD in the Netherlands. Um, suddenly I'm offered a chair, um, uh, like a professor of general practice pretty quickly after that my work grows in this area.

Um, are you

**Judson:** still

**Glyn:** practicing? Yes, I'm still practicing. I'm still practicing in, um, in the Docklands, in Cardiff, um, an area where there are refugees from Somalia and, and so on. So it's quite a poor area. Um, uh, but then the opportunity comes because I've been to Dartmouth College here in the USA, a few summers for a summer school, and I suddenly there's an opportunity, some I'm invited to say, would you like to come to Dartmouth to.

To for a couple of years, um, to help us research this area. Dartmouth has always had an interest in this area from Jack Weinberg's work here in practice variation onwards. So, uh, I arrive here, uh, saying I'm gonna be in the USA for two years, but that turns into a longer time. Got it,

**Judson:** got it. You've also invented something called the option grid.

Where did that come into this chronologically?

**Glyn:** So, one of the grants that we got in Wales was to make a web tool for breast cancer women with breast cancer. It was called Breast X, um, a breast decision Explorer Breast X. And it took an enormous amount of time to look through it. Probably if you read everything in the webpages, we'll be talking 40 minutes.

Hmm. And we analyzed where people were using this web tool and they were spending most of their time on a table where we'd had a few questions and comparison between the mastectomy and the lumpectomy with radiotherapy. And we'd asked a few questions and answer these questions in cells on the comparison table.

And they were spending most of their time there because that was the most useful feature of this website, which was far too long.

**Judson:** 40 minutes. And inside of there, there's this matrix, this

**Glyn:** exactly. Table. Exactly. Decided to call it eventually, we called it an option grid.

**Judson:** Where did that come from?

**Glyn:** Somewhere in here, I think.

What was,

**Judson:** what was that about? Well, it was, it's a grid and there's options on it. Yeah, exactly. It's obvious. Yeah.

**Glyn:** And the name stuck, you know, and I think it's. Yeah, the name has stuck for, with quite a few people actually.

**Judson:** There's actually options. You've also invented these, you know, catchy sounding metrics as well, and it's almost as if they're outta the Stanford Design School.

So collaborate, integrate, considerate. Why are these so important? Why does medicine need them so badly? And, and give me a real story of how they've actually changed a, how a clinic or a hospital treats patients.

**Glyn:** Okay. So we started with collaborate, right? I like catchy names, right?

**Judson:** Just part of your art background.

**Glyn:** I, I guess so. Maybe. Right? I guess so. I like catching names and I, I wanted to make a measure that people would remember to collaborate is about what exactly what we're trying to help. It says what it says on the tin, right? So. These three items. We worked a lot on the, the wording of them. We interviewed a ton of patients about have we got these words right?

And if I can, I'll try and remember the items for you and I'll ask you the items. Your last visit with your clinician, how much effort was made to inform you about your health issues? Was it zero, no effort at all? Nine. Maximum effort. Three. Three. Second question, how much effort was made to listen to what matters most to you?

**Judson:** A four and a good day.

**Glyn:** Third question. How much effort was made to include what matters most to you in what happens next?

**Judson:** The same? I'll give it a three.

**Glyn:** So let's add those up. Three and four. And three. I think that's 10. 10. So the maximum score is 27. Three nines, right? Mm-hmm. So what is that? You've got 10 out of twenty seven, twenty seven.

Let's call that you call it a third. Third, 30%. Mm-hmm. So now I ask doctors this question, how, what do you think patients score for you is at on a percentage level? And most clinicians say, maybe they give me a 10% on these items because they think that they haven't done very well across these three items.

So they know that. And then I ask the patients, um, themselves, we do, we don't ask this to the questions, to the doctors. We ask the patients. So I'm gonna ask you now, what percentage do you give, do you think? What percentage do you think that patients give their doctors? Are they 20%, 50% or higher?

**Judson:** Lower than 20%.

**Glyn:** Patients give clinician score about 65%, which is much higher than what most doctors expect. Okay. So patients give doctors high scores on the collaborate score. In other words, they give, they're very generous with their scores. Hmm, interesting. Yeah. But clinicians kind of know that they don't do well across these three items.

Okay. So my feeling is that these simple questions are beginning to address the degree to which clinicians think they're doing shared decision making, but they also give us a clue of what patients are thinking. Because they do vary between doctors and doctors. Some doctors get high scores, some doctors get much lower scores on the collaborate items.

**Judson:** So they're pretty useful comparatively in within the same practice then?

**Glyn:** Yes. If we had enough data. But your second question is, is any healthcare system using these? Mm-hmm. Not really. We, we've seen them happen in research projects, but no system is using these routinely, even though they take about 20 seconds to measure.

**Judson:** How does that feel to be a researcher that's worked so hard on this and it's not being adopted?

**Glyn:** Well,

**Judson:** that,

**Glyn:** that's the way of the world in terms of research. Um, the option grid story is a little different, but, you know, um, measurement of patient reported outcome, and this is a patient reported experience measure.

It's very difficult to get them implemented. Yeah.

**Judson:** Yet you're telling me that this is shown to be effective, this is quantified.

**Glyn:** Well, we now can quantify what patients think of, of their clinicians. Yeah. Um, and yeah, with the other measure I mentioned, the recording, we can also actually observe what clinicians are doing.

But the interest in measuring this in a system level at the practice level is virtually non-existent. Just

**Judson:** so, and you say non-existent anywhere in the world, or this is the United States. We're not using it. Well,

**Glyn:** we do it in research projects. People get research funding and they measure these things. In the normal world, nobody is measuring this.

**Judson:** Why?

**Glyn:** Well, I guess nobody's interested in the result.

**Judson:** And yet the, uh, result creates a better relationship in patient visit lower utilization, better outcomes. Yes. But we're not interested in this. Yes. How do you reconcile that?

**Glyn:** Well, that's a tough one. That's a tough one to, I cannot reconcile that I spent, you know, 20 or 30 years trying to promote this way of working.

'cause I think it's in the, it gives advantage to patients. Yeah. I think it would give Advant major advantage to health systems. But I also happen to know, now it gives advantages to clinicians too.

**Judson:** You mentioned Jack Weinberg. He, is this why he brought you here for two years?

**Glyn:** It wasn't Jack actually, um, it was Al Mulley.

Um, he had come here to Dartmouth, from Harvard to work. And he knew of my interest in shared making and my research in it. And he said, would you like to come to over to Dartmouth to work? And I said, okay. For two years I will.

**Judson:** How did he think that that fit into his broader goals for Dartmouth?

**Glyn:** There was a new unit here called Healthcare Delivery Science, um, by the President Kim, who was here, here at the time.

And, and actually that led to the Master's in Healthcare Delivery Science, which I think you've done. I have. Um, yeah, so that was a whole development and I came to join that group.

**Judson:** We've talked about collaborate. What, what was, what is integrate? What is considerate?

**Glyn:** Integrate is a measure four item measure of the degree to which, um, people feel that their, their healthcare has been well integrated or coordinated.

Four item measure works pretty well. I don't think anybody's using it. And considerate is about what matters to you as a patient with serious illness at the end of your life.

**Judson:** Thinking through, and it's a, it's a field that I don't know well, Glenn, but maybe you know better than I do. And, and one of the things I'm trying to do with this podcast series is understand specifically in the United States a, a healthcare market that we know many things that we can and should be doing better.

Mm-hmm. And we're not doing that. And I know that's not unique to the United States, but the field, I don't know well, is implementation science.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm.

**Judson:** How, how do we go about taking best practices in medicine and applying them systematically to the work that we do, recognizing here we have a place where we haven't effectively done that.

**Glyn:** I think you put value on them. In some way. Does that mean dollars? Not necessarily. I don't think so. I mean, incentivization of these behaviors might be problematic actually, but you put value on them in a different way. You say to clinicians who adopt this approach, you are esteemed, you are the professional leaders.

You are champions, you are delivering the best, um, patient outcomes, and you are practicing medicine at the top of your professional license. You are curious about patients, you're curious about what matters to them, and you're delivering preference, sensitive, informed decisions that make everybody happy.

Both you the patients, the and the patients. And by the way, it leads to much less complaints and litigation.

**Judson:** We've, you know, we've got a million studies here showing that, um, patient reported outcomes are the future. That's an ex exaggeration, you know, such as turning every clinic into a research lab, but it's crawling at a snail's pace.

And I'm just trying to dig deeper, like what's the real friction? Is it cowardice, is it red tape, or are we just lazy?

**Glyn:** Well, I think the system in here, in the US and many, many other countries, I'm not pointing at the US necessarily, is that that's not the value that's driving the system. The driving is efficiency, volume versus putting quality on the conversations and the wise decisions made.

I have a quip that, you know, there's a million boardrooms in medicine every day, and the boardroom is that interaction between the clinician and the patients. Those decisions. As to what to prescribe, what to refer, what test to order is, where the money is spent. All the money is there to, to fulfill those decisions.

What I prescribe, what test I order, who I refer you to. And so if you get those decisions right? Mm-hmm. I think the cost into the system would look after itself because if you made the decisions in the interest of the patients and the clinicians working together, you'd get a much more high quality healthcare system.

**Judson:** So frame this then differently. You're, you're the, let's say you're the president of a large insurance company.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm.

**Judson:** What are you doing then to make sure that some of these things get implemented?

**Glyn:** Well, we're not that far away from a mechanism where we could, right. Let me play out at. Maybe a science fiction situation, but we're not that far away from it.

We know that ambient recording has happened now. Um, and ambient recording is being used in order to help the clinician put, um, information into the clinical record.

**Judson:** I wanna go there, but let's describe what ambient listening is for those that may not know.

**Glyn:** So, ambient listening is, imagine you and I are the clinician and the doctor, and somewhere in the background there's a recording device.

**Judson:** Okay?

**Glyn:** And that recording is digitized and then it goes into a transcript, and that transcript gets analyzed by artificial intelligence and codes that, so that the doctor doesn't have to type afterwards. It saves many hours of the doctor's time. So that's the current use of it, and it's a very good use.

Okay? Don't get me wrong.

**Judson:** Yeah.

**Glyn:** But what a treasure trove you have in that recording.

**Judson:** Yeah,

**Glyn:** because you, we have the measures. You could analyze the recordings to say to what degree did this doctor follow guidelines? To what degree did this doctor share some options? To what degree did they become interested the patient's view, and to what degree did that doctor and the patient work together to find a decision that suited them both?

**Judson:** Yeah.

**Glyn:** We have the digital information, so what's stopping us from putting a score on that and giving friendly feedback to the clinician to say, you know, you're doing pretty well, but you could do better by doing it. The B and c. I'm not saying punish the clinicians who are doing poorly. I'm just saying give the ver mirror to say you could improve here.

**Judson:** Yeah. If we were to adopt decision aid tools, option grids across the country. What would happen to the cost and utilization of healthcare in this country?

**Glyn:** Well, we don't know for sure, but all the studies that we've done in, in elective surgery, for example, the studies done by Group Health before they, uh, got taken over by Kaiser, I think in Seattle showed was it 10 or 50 degree drop in the cost of operations across that system.

So there's evidence in elective surgery that the, the, um, rate of operations drops quite dramatically when you use these kind of tools in the hands of actually clinicians who are not that well trained in shared decision making. They just use the tools.

**Judson:** I wanna talk a little bit about learning health systems, which I understand you'd have some background in.

There's a lot of people, a lot of organizations, American health systems that like to virtue signal or brand themselves as learning health systems. As if it's, it's a buzzword, something that goes on their PowerPoints, but, but who's actually walking that walk in the United States?

**Glyn:** Well, I think there are a few.

Um, I, I teach this area, uh, to the masters in public health students, um, and other students here at Dartmouth. And the one example, I think that's, there's a few examples that stand out. I'm just gonna talk about two of them. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation under the leadership of Marshall, Bruce Marshall. He may have retired now, but for the last 10 or 15 years, I can't remember quite how long he's invested in the learning healthcare system across many, many clinics that look after patients with cystic fibrosis, young people.

Okay. And. What they did is to invest in data collection from patient reported outcomes and other measures to say, how well are these hundreds of clinics doing when compared to each other? Okay. And so you have an infrastructure of data collection and then a data comparison, and then a feedback loop to all the practice to say, here are the people who are doing really well.

Mm-hmm. At looking after these patients. And the others say, yeah, but we're not doing quite as well. How can we get to be as good as those people? So they have a meeting regularly to say, how can we learn from one another? It takes humility, it takes courage, it takes sharing of data, and it takes benchmarking along the way.

That's what a learning healthcare system is. And by the way, they also got some very new drugs in this area, and they implemented those very quickly because of this existing network.

**Judson:** What are the rest of us getting wrong?

**Glyn:** Well, it's quite tough to do this actually. You know, it sounds pretty easy to collect the data, share it across different systems, right?

Mm-hmm. Different practices and different healthcare systems. What you need is enormous amount of leadership and courage to do that. Break down the silos of how can we share data at a granular enough level to compare ourselves with each other. That takes bravery and honesty. And I think most clinical systems are in this competitive game of we don't wanna share outcomes with other people 'cause we don't wanna look bad.

Another example, um, from inflammatory bowel disease. Yeah. Um, for young infants, there's a group here, um, I think at Dartmouth was involved quite a lot in this. They did this learning healthcare system slightly differently. They were worried about, um, the child, um, with inflammatory bowel disease having, um, more attacks.

Yeah. And the doctor said, yeah, we definitely need to bring the level of these attacks down. And then somebody said, yeah, but is that what the parents worry about? So they asked the parents, they involved the parents in this decision about what to prioritize, and the parents said, yep, we are interested in remission levels going down too.

But we are interested mostly in steroid free remission, which is steroids. Uh, we don't want steroids because they affect the growth of our children. So they modified the outcome measure that they wanted to focus on. So for a few years, they measured to what, how successful each of the practices was at getting their steroid free remission down.

And. Over a matter of a decade or two, they went from about 30 or 40% steroid free remission, right up to 80% steroid free remission across all the practices. Wow. So that's a big change. Now, it's not a randomized trial. There were other secular changes going on, new drugs and so on. Okay. But as a group, these practice learned and improved together,

**Judson:** but we're not yet seeing it in FQHC systems, hospital systems, academics even.

**Glyn:** No, because there are challenges to that degree of leadership and data sharing that make that happen. Yeah. And these are typically led by strong leaders or investments by foundations or other systems. And without systems saying, we care about this ability to learn together, you won't see it happening.

**Judson:** You know, many of us in America are naive to Wales. We, you have a prince, maybe. Um, there's a lion on your flag. I think.

**Glyn:** Dragon

**Judson:** Dragon. Excuse me. I wanna get that right. Um, yeah. Yeah. And here you are, a Welsh innovator in this crazy American healthcare delivery system that we have. How does your Welsh perspective, uh, shake up the US approach to co-production and shared decision making?

And, and be honest. Um, what do you find downright baffling in this American healthcare work?

**Glyn:** What baffles me about the US is the, is the lack of solidarity at the community level, at the population level. I, I visit a lot of countries now and the Netherlands. Denmark, Sweden, and I see such a different approach to solidarity across the population.

They have a will to say, let's lift all the boats, not leave some people behind. And America buffs me because you leave a lot of people behind.

**Judson:** I would imagine it's pretty similar to the uk and yet you're saying it's quite different.

**Glyn:** Well, it's more so I would say it's the, there's, there's a lack of kind of, let's look af after everybody here.

Insurance coverage is just a prime example. Right. In the UK we've got universal coverage to the NHS. Yeah. And in many countries that that provides a better healthcare system. Here, if you're not employed, you're kind of on your own and that's tough.

**Judson:** Yeah. You've spent all this time researching SDM and practicing.

You mentioned you were in the Dock yards or Docklands, or in Cardiff, which I've never had the pleasure to be in Cardiff before. Give me a story where you used SDM effectively in your practice.

**Glyn:** I, I think mostly at the time I was a family doctor and a lot of the time the, I inherited a practice in, in this poor area, in the dock.

Lots of people from West India, lots of people from Somalia, um, many of them, um, from the Horn of Africa after the war there. Um, the English was not great and my Somali was terrible. Um, so, you know, we, we had a tough time communicating. One of the things they expected because of their background is that, and also their previous experience with their previous doctors is that they get a cold, they need an antibiotic.

Okay. And I guess this is what I was facing day in, day out. Um, and trying to say to them, you don't need an antibiotic. This is just a cold that's gonna go away. Wasn't working so well. Right. Got into conflict it. Oh, a previous doctor gave us antibiotics. What's wrong with you? Yeah, you're a bad doctor. And so in a way, this idea of, let me just explain to you, um, what are the options here and there.

As I saw it, there were three. I can give you an antibiotic. Um, and you may well, you know, see in a few days that this cold or whatever will go away, but it may not have been due to the antibiotic. It just may have recovered on its own. Um, I could not give you an antibiotic. Um. And this probably will go away in two or three days anyway, but you may feel that it would've gone away quicker if I'd given you the antibiotic or I can give you a delayed antibiotic, which is say, I'll write you a prescription, but just wait two days because I think it will have gone away then.

So I gave them three options, and I say, the reason I don't want to give you an antibiotic for you to take today is because if I give antibiotics to everybody in this community, the resistance will develop to the antibiotic and this will not work in the future. So let's keep this, try and keep this antibiotic for when things are really bad.

And in any case, in about 10, 20% of children who get an antibiotic, they get diarrhea. And that gives them more problems than even the calls that they've got right now. So there was a lot of investment in the understanding, the options. Not saying I'm denying you the antibiotic, but giving them some agency and autonomy in the decision.

And a lot of the time people say, okay, then we'll see how it goes. Or I'll take the delayed prescription, I'll keep it for two days and things haven't resolved. I'll go to the pharmacy then. So that's an example of very simple giving options, trying to inform them, trying to invest in this relationship because if you give an antibiotic for every cold, every time they carry the cold, they want an antibiotic.

You're creating a rod for your own back.

**Judson:** My mind's going to the opiate crisis in the United States Could what you just described there, to better educate. Um, your patients around antibiotics be applied to what is seen as drug seeking behavior in the primary care practices across America?

**Glyn:** Wow, that's such a difficult question.

Um, I don't know. It's not my area really. Um, when you become addicted to medication, that behavior is really complicated, right? So you have to have a contract with people to say, how are we going to wean you off this area? The problem with opiates is how you got there in the first place that you're taking them so regularly.

Once you become addicted, it's a very different problem. So I'm not quite sure I can answer that one for you.

**Judson:** Interesting. Yeah. We've been talking about SDM. Mm, and mostly, or exclusively, we've been talking about the patient bedside and the patient visit. And yet you started to go into talking about communities mm-hmm.

And communal living and, uh, I think you said singularity before. What did you say? Solidarity. Uh, you talked about solidarity. Mm. In the, in the non, outside the us. Mm-hmm. How does SDM scale to the community level as well?

**Glyn:** Well, I, I think it does, but we haven't seen enough penetrance to see the community effect just yet.

Right. Because a lot of the resistance we get from doctors is to say, my patients don't want this. They're not used to it. Um, and, and that's a challenge because, um, if I begin to offer you choices and no other doctor has offered you choices, they begin to think what a funny doctor that is. He doesn't know what he's doing.

Interesting, right? He, he can't be very well educated. He's giving me the choice and the patients at first will say, Hey, I, I'm not here for you to ask me. I'm here for you to tell me what to do. And so it takes a lot of skill to be able to offer options in a way that people trust you. And I think that would be, it's a very nice saying when I was training in general practice, you end up with the patients you deserve, meaning that you invest in their education so that they understand how you work and what you are prepared to do in terms of giving them the right treatment that's in their interest over time.

**Judson:** In your experience as you're driving SDM into your GP practice, were your patients seeing you as less competent or less qualified because of you were giving them so many options?

**Glyn:** We had a few of those reactions to say,

**Judson:** Hey, you know, just tell me what to do. Why? Why do you think patients are looking for that?

Have we trained them to behave that way?

**Glyn:** Yes. Um,

**Judson:** I, I think that's what they expect, right? So maybe we're largely untraining them with this SDM work.

**Glyn:** We're completely untraining them. We, we are, and you have to do it with respect, right? You can't just say. What do you want? Do you want A or B? Because that just impossible.

You haven't got them in the information. Yeah. So what you need to do is to say, I'm giving you A and B because I'm really interested in which one is gonna suit you best. Yeah. I know a lot about A and BI can explain it to you, but then I'm really interested is what's gonna suit you and your family. Yeah.

So that's a process and it takes a bit of investment.

**Judson:** Yeah. One of the things I care deeply about Glen is having been an executive in rural America, we're, we're beyond crisis when it comes to recruiting, retaining primary care physicians. Mm-hmm. Some say it's the burnout. Mm-hmm. Um, some say it's the value misalignment of the system.

I think it's probably all the above. Um, what effect does SDM have on physician burnout if they apply it in their practice?

**Glyn:** In a healthcare system where you're driving doctors. To see a lot of patients very quickly.

**Judson:** Okay.

**Glyn:** I think shared decision making can be very difficult,

**Judson:** which just real quick right there.

That's how most, at least my experience of one, I had 96 clinics, we were seeing 510,000 visits a year. Yeah. We were paid exclusively on a per visit basis. Right. And paying 75th 80th percentile for physicians in the United States. Some of them were doing $320,000 a year as fm, straight outta residency.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm.

**Judson:** As a ccf, recovering CFO as I joke, I needed them to be busy to pay for that, that cost. I would be concerned then about the loss of productivity. I'm deeply concerned as an executive in America about the loss of productivity of physicians.

**Glyn:** Of course you are. Um, and I understand that, but as. If the system is driving to productivity, many patients seen very quickly, you are not going to get the benefit of shared decision making.

And I kick myself in my career that I haven't really understood the benefit to clinicians of shared decision making more quickly. So I'm gonna take a bit of a digression here and explain that to you. I've just finished a study, um, with about 24 champions of shared decision making. So these are people, doctors now who've really said, I'm invested in this idea.

I'm doing it in my practice. They're active clinicians, not academics, uh, although some of them do a bit of teaching. And these are from 10 countries in about 12 different specialties.

**Judson:** Okay?

**Glyn:** So I interviewed them and, and I asked them the question, what benefits do you get from doing shared decision making with your patients?

Uh. The results have really surprised me. Okay. Some of them, uh, as we've mentioned, mentioned the consequences of doing shared decision making. Right. Um, people are more satisfied, they make better decisions, better decisions aligned with their preferences, and they get to better outcomes. So they know all that and they say, I feel good about that as a doctor.

My patients get better outcomes. That's great. They also say, it deepens my relationship with my patient. I get a lot out of that because these patients are more loyal. They, they come back to me, they trust me. My reputation grows in the community. That's, that's good. They also say that their teams are beginning to pick up on it.

They work as a better, as a team. They're nurses and their, and other people around them. But what surprised me more than anything is that they said, my professional self-esteem goes up when I do share decision making. Well, they feel better about themselves as clinicians.

**Judson:** Okay.

**Glyn:** And they also said, it protects me against burnout.

And they also said, which surprised me a lot, I think it defends me against moral injury. And so I'm kicking myself that I didn't realize this before because the way I've been training clinicians about shared decision making is to say, Hey, you don't communicate so well.

**Judson:** Yeah.

**Glyn:** Hey, you don't do patient centeredness so well, I shouldn't have been doing that.

I should have said, let me try and explain to you some of the benefits to you of this. Well, and to your patients. Then they would've said to me, talk to my chief exec, my chief financial officer, or my chief operations officer. 'cause they're on my back to see how many patients a day.

**Judson:** 10 in the morning, 10 in the afternoon.

**Glyn:** Right? Yeah. But you as a system leader need to understand that if you're gonna have a workforce that survives, you need to change the incentive system. You don't need to drive them. You need to give them more time to invest in these relationships. And you need to change the financial system that DR has driven you to this hamster wheel.

**Judson:** So I'm hearing you tell me that as an executive, I actually need to support my physicians with a potentially longer visit. Mm-hmm. To reduce their burnout. Yes.

The reality is in rural America and many parts of urban America, because the physician crisis has become so bad, the shortage. Sure. The community members are begging us to create more access.

**Glyn:** I understand. I understand. And as you drive them harder, the less people will want to work in your system. They will burn out and they'll go away.

**Judson:** So I'm hearing you say that we're actually pushing the wrong direction on this leverage point. Mm-hmm.

**Glyn:** I, I think if you, uh, back to my point, you know, all the money gets spent in the decisions that the clinicians make with that patient. The issue about the workforce, um, numbers, um, and driving them to be more efficient is, is a problem the system has created, um, in my view.

Now, is there a need for more visits and more referrals and more tests? Uh, I'm not quite sure how to solve that, but they do. I, I am convinced, I think that if we made more investment in the right decisions, um, at the right time, you, the cost to the system overall Yeah. Would level out.

**Judson:** I just, maybe let's make this personal.

So you're CEO of, of a, of a health system that has an average wait time of 120 days to get in to see primary care. Mm-hmm. What are you doing to support primary care

**Glyn:** to what's driving that demand? I would begin to analyze what's driving that demand. And also understand is that, is the system creating its own demand in some way?

Is it. Driving unsatisfied patients who don't have autonomy, who are really anxious, um, and need to have this kind of visit after visit, after visit. So something is driving this demand. Um, maybe it's the income because if you set up a system that says, I need to see you every few weeks to check your blood pressure, to check whatever, to take another test, you are driving demand inside the system maybe in order to create the income.

If you create more autonomy, more agency, and better decisions, you may see the demand side coming down. Now that's just a hypothesis, but there's something really odd about a system that has to, um, deal with this access issue and poor decisions at the same time.

**Judson:** You've, you've hit on it, but I want to pull it out a little bit clearer.

W in my mind I've been focusing on primary care.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm.

**Judson:** Drawing out. Does shared decision making also apply to work well in a specialty or procedural space as well?

**Glyn:** Extremely well in that space, um, because these are high cost, complex procedures usually that are not often what the patient is looking for when they're fully informed.

**Judson:** Where are you going next with this research?

**Glyn:** One of the challenges that I faced over the last decade or more is the implementation of this approach into practice. And I'm beginning to feel that trying to implement this approach in a system such that you've described, which is driven by volume, is an impossible task. So I'm not sure where I can go.

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm applying for research funds, um, trying to get implementation studies done. I'm not working with any healthcare system that really wants to do this. I wish they would come to me and say, how can we do this? Right? But they're not, I, I go for research grants. One of the things that I will do from the next few years is to talk to more doctors about the benefits to them and try and find maybe with your help some chief execs and say, let's give this a go.

Let's try something different. Let's try and reduce demand so we make more time for our clinicians and we drive them less hard and give them more opportunity to become more self-fulfilled as clinicians, knowing that what they are doing is not betraying their values. To quickly making bad decisions, spending too short a time, not being curious about the person they've got in front of 'em.

**Judson:** I asked you what you would do as a CEO of the health system, but I wanna ask it a little bit differently and reframe that you're Secretary of Health at the United States. How are you going about rolling out co-production SDM in the United States?

**Glyn:** I would ask a lot of patients, do you think that a clinician who explains things well to you, who really listens to what you want, and together you're making a decision in your best interest, is that the kind of healthcare you want?

I would guarantee you that most people would say yes, and I would say, okay, how can we design that system? It. It probably requires a lot of different measures measuring things that I've tried to bring to my research. Right. Yeah. To what degree are people sharing reasonable options with patients? To what degree are they really paying attention?

What matters most to them and their family, and how can I finance a system that pays attention to that? It probably needs everybody to have insurance. It probably needs everybody to have a good family doctor.

**Judson:** Yeah.

**Glyn:** And it probably needs specialists who are not driven to make a million dollars a year.

**Judson:** That's gonna be hard.

**Glyn:** I know.

**Judson:** What questions have I not asked you that I should have been asking you? While I've got this time,

**Glyn:** I think you've asked me a lot of questions. Very tough questions. I have. I've skipped a few too. Um,

so, uh, I would probably, uh, ask you to say, why are some countries doing so much better, with much less spending?

America is spending more than any country on earth, on healthcare. Their life expectancy is going down. Yeah. A good percentage of Americans don't have health insurance. This is crazy.

**Judson:** It is. Is is health insurance the same as healthcare?

**Glyn:** No. No. Not, not at all.

**Judson:** Through this project. Some, some have identified. That we've actually made things worse by giving people plastic cards, without looking at the access points. And, and the, and the, um, supply side of clinicians, maybe not worse, but we, we've almost created this due tension point in the system where now people have an insurance card mm-hmm.

But we haven't invested in, in the workforce.

**Glyn:** Sure.

**Judson:** Um,

**Glyn:** and so

**Judson:** that's been fascinating

**Glyn:** through this process. Mm-hmm. But the workforce, I think, needs to be really given the opportunity to act as per healthcare professionals Yeah. To, to be the ethical health professionals that they went into medical school to be.

**Judson:** Yeah.

**Glyn:** That's being driven out of them.

**Judson:** Well, I'm, I'm actually, my, my mind's gonna take from this conversation how you said maybe the system is creating its own demand cycle.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm.

**Judson:** Um, and that demand cycle may not be aligned towards health. It might be aligned, aligned for, towards something else. Profit.

And maybe there's fragility and scarcity being created inside of there.

**Glyn:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I, you know, I've been in this country now for 12 years Right. But I'm scared about being in this country for the next 10 or 15 years.

**Judson:** Yeah. I'm gonna ask you more specifically, um, where do you think is a very powerful leverage point?

A place where in the American system that we could all push to make a big impact

**Glyn:** leadership, wherever that might be. And it's gonna take brave leaders to say, if we carry along this way, seeking what Elliot Fisher calls, you know, it's the most extractive industry in the US right? Yeah. It's extracting money out of the population.

'cause we're up to all 18% GDP. It's extracting money outta the system. That is not going to give people good healthcare, nevermind good health. So it needs leadership at the executive level to say, let's, let's go in a different direction here. Let's look after the workforce in order to look after the patients.

**Judson:** Yeah. Let's say we're having this conversation in three years. What's the single metric that you and I could look at to say we've really moved the needle in the last three years?

**Glyn:** Um, I, I would suggest that the metric would be that you've got some health systems paying attention to some of the things that we've talked about, some health being, healthcare systems being redesigned in order to lack after the workforce that are aligned with the patient's interest.

**Judson:** Beautiful. We've been asking our guest to leave us a question for the next guest. And without you knowing who that person is, what would you like to ask them? Um,

**Glyn:** well, I guess I'd like to ask them if they agree with me.

**Judson:** Is that important? Um,

**Glyn:** because I'm, I'm out, I'm on a limb, right? I, I'm a bit of a lone voice, I think.

Why are you a lone voice on this? Well, yeah, that's why I'm, I'm asking myself that question. Well, I'm not completely alone. There are quite a few clinicians that are coming along. But in terms of the generality of clinicians, I'm a bit of a lone

**Judson:** voice. I will tell you, um, someone said there's a difference between trailblazers and leadership, and then of course there's followers.

But if leadership is taking people down a trail, trailblazing is building the trail that doesn't exist. So, Dr. Glenn Iwan, thank you for doing the work that you're doing. It's making an impact. And thank you for building that
