title: "Scott Reiner: Trading the C-suite for community impact"
date: "2020-01-02"
description: "I worked for a number of years as a senior hospital executive for Adventist Health, a $5 billion system in the western US.  Our guest in this episode, Scott Reiner, was the CEO of that system until, at the peak of his career, he walked away to launch a pair of social ventures working to reframe the approach to healthcare in rural southern Africa. In his time at Adventist Health, Scott completely changed the way that I think about healthcare, and I had always wanted to have a chance to sit down with him and hear his take on his journey and on healthcare in general. I hope that you find our conversation as interesting and inspiring as I did."

# About Us

## 🧭 Our Mission

Health and the delivery of healthcare are topics of importance around the globe. In the U.S., our system generates worse outcomes at greater cost than any peer nation. We ask:

- Why is that?  
- What can we do about it?  
- Why have we been talking about this forever but not made things better yet?

Healthcare Reframed is for people who want to dig in, rethink, and make change.

## 🎙️ Who We Are

We've had the **time and space to learn and think hard** about healthcare through conversation—so we created this podcast series and site to:

1. **Reflect with smart, experienced healthcare leaders**  
2. **Amplify important voices and stories**  
3. **Explore deeper issues through scroll‑story modules**  
4. **Bring energy and insight back to all of us**

## 🔍 Why It’s Different

We’re drowning in healthcare content—endless podcasts, websites, corporate and government pages, medical journals. But most curation exists to sell *something*, or rack up clicks.  
**This is different.**

- No ads • No paywalls • No sponsors  
- Just genuine curiosity and critical inquiry  
- Help us keep it running with a donation if you find value here
